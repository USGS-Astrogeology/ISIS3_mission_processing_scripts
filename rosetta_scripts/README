scripts for processing Rosetta OSIRIS imagery of the comet CG-67P

This directory contains several scripts that automate the projection of
OSIRIS imagery into different viewing geometry. Because of how irregular
the comet is, the standard map projection process is not applicable.

There are two high level scripts to do this:

ros_osiris_reproject_serial

  This script projects a list of images one at a time and then mosaics them.

ros_osiris_reproject_parallel

  This script projects a list of images in parallel by dispatching to a cluster.
  It is setup for use with the Nebula cluster at the USGS Astrogeology Science
  Center, but the sbatch commands can be modified to work with any other
  cluster that uses SLURM.

These scripts use two utility scripts:

ros_osiris_reproject_image

  This script takes a single image from ingestion to projection into the new
  viewing geometry.

ros_osiris_mosaic

  This script mosaics a set of projected images into a single averaged image.

For more details and usage of any of these scripts see the documentation inside
each of them.
